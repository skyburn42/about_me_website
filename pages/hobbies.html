  <h1> Photography</h1>
<p>I used to love Photography and it used to be something that I wanted to really get into when I was younger, but realized it would be
  better to be just a past time hobby. Nature and Wildlife photograpy is my thing!
</p>
</div>

<div class="parallax two"></div>
<div class="parallaxContent">
  <h1> Hiking</h1>
<p>Hiking is my favorite way to be able to get a good exercise in, while being outdoors
   discovering new trails and hidden scenic views that nature has for me. My favorite hikes 
  are when there is a nice waterfall or lake to see at the end.</p>
</div>

<div class="parallax three"></div>
<div class="parallaxContent">
  <h1> Boating</h1>
<p>Boating has only become a recent top favorite hobby of mine, and that is soley because I learned how to 
  wakeboard! Getting up on the water on a nice hot day is something I can do all summer long. Unless there 
  is a camping trip planned. Camping trumps boating any day
</p>
</div>

<div class="parallax four"></div>
<div class="parallaxContent">
  <h1> Camping</h1>
<p>There is nothing better then to be able to sit by a campfire at night, with nothing obscuring
  your view of the night sky. Camping is so relaxing and is my favorite way to spend a weekend vacation
  away from civilization, roast some marshmallows, and listen to the silent sounds of the trees, nightlife, 
and the crackling of the fire. (This is the only picture I have of a campfire and roasting marshmallows, at my 
house so not technically camping but you get the idea!)</p>
